# 🗺️ I2Py Disaster Declarations and Population Visualizer

This application integrates FEMA disaster declaration data with U.S. Census population data to generate paired, timestamped CSV and visual outputs.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Data Integration**  
- Reads **FEMA Disaster Declarations** (`FemaWebDisasterDeclarations.csv`)  
- Reads **U.S. Census Data** (`DECENNIALCD1182020.P1-2025-06-08T162550.csv`)  
- Combines them into an integrated dataset, aligned by state.

✅ **Data Visualization**  
- Produces **bar + line charts** visualizing population and disaster counts.  
- Saves visuals in `Sample Outputs/`, named with a unique timestamp.

✅ **Data Export**  
- Saves integrated summary data to a CSV file, using the same timestamp as the image.

✅ **Consistent Naming Convention**  
- Paired outputs are named like:
  - `Population_and_Disaster_Declarations_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png`
  - `Population_and_Disaster_Declarations_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.13 (or compatible Python 3.7+)
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib

Install dependencies via pip:

```bash
"""pip install pandas matplotlib"""

⚙️ How to Run
Run the script from the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
python I2Py.py
The script will:

Load the census and FEMA data

Integrate them by state

Print sample outputs to console

Generate and save:

A PNG image of the visualization

A CSV file summarizing the data

Both files will be saved in the Sample Outputs directory with a timestamp in the name.

💡 Notes
The script uses a timestamp to avoid overwriting previous outputs.

If no data is present for some states, they will be excluded from the visualization and CSV export.

📈 Future Enhancements? (TBD)
Support for additional data sources (e.g., hazard severity, economic impact).

Enhanced interactive visualizations.

Automated updates for new disaster data.
